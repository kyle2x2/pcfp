# Feature Development SOP - PCFP v8.4

## üéØ Standard Operating Procedure for New Features

This document outlines our collaborative process for developing new features in PCFP, ensuring we get it right the first time through thorough planning and clarification.

## üìã Phase 1: Initial Request & Understanding

### **Step 1: Feature Request**
- User describes the desired feature
- Assistant acknowledges and confirms understanding
- Assistant asks initial clarifying questions if needed

### **Step 2: High-Level Plan**
- Assistant creates a conceptual plan
- Outlines the general approach
- Identifies potential challenges
- Proposes implementation strategy

### **Step 3: User Confirmation**
- User confirms the plan direction
- User may suggest modifications
- Both parties agree on general approach

## ü§î Phase 2: Detailed Clarification (CRITICAL)

### **Step 4: Comprehensive Questioning**
Assistant must ask detailed clarifying questions about:

#### **Functional Behavior:**
- What exactly should happen when user performs each action?
- What are the edge cases and error scenarios?
- How should the system handle invalid inputs?
- What should happen if operations fail?

#### **User Experience:**
- How should the interface look and feel?
- What animations or transitions are desired?
- How should the feature integrate with existing UI?
- What feedback should users receive?

#### **Data Management:**
- How should data be stored and retrieved?
- What relationships exist with other data?
- How should data be validated?
- What happens during data conflicts?

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- Should we use existing patterns or create new ones?
- What performance considerations are important?
- How should the feature scale?
- What browser/device compatibility is required?

### **Step 5: User Response & Refinement**
- User provides detailed answers to all questions
- Assistant asks follow-up questions for clarity
- Both parties refine the plan based on answers
- No implementation begins until all questions are resolved

## üìù Phase 3: Final Plan Documentation

### **Step 6: Complete Implementation Plan**
Assistant creates a comprehensive plan including:

#### **Technical Specifications:**
- Exact HTML structure changes
- CSS styling requirements
- JavaScript function specifications
- Data flow and state management

#### **User Experience Details:**
- Exact user interaction flows
- Error handling and messaging
- Animation specifications
- Responsive behavior

#### **Implementation Steps:**
- Ordered list of implementation tasks
- Dependencies between steps
- Testing criteria for each step
- Success metrics

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- All identified edge cases
- Error messages and user feedback
- Fallback behaviors
- Recovery mechanisms

### **Step 7: Final User Review**
- User reviews the complete plan
- User confirms all details are correct
- User may request final adjustments
- Both parties agree on exact implementation

## üöÄ Phase 4: Implementation

### **Step 8: Development**
- Assistant implements exactly according to the plan
- No deviations without user approval
- Clear progress updates during implementation
- Immediate notification of any issues

### **Step 9: Testing & Validation**
- Assistant tests all specified functionality
- Verifies edge cases and error handling
- Confirms responsive behavior
- Validates against success criteria

### **Step 10: User Review**
- User tests the implemented feature
- User provides feedback on functionality
- User confirms feature meets requirements
- Any issues are addressed immediately

## üìã Required Questions Template

For every new feature, the assistant must ask:

### **Core Functionality:**
1. What is the primary purpose of this feature?
2. What are all the possible user actions?
3. What should happen for each action?
4. What are the success and failure states?

### **User Interface:**
1. How should the feature look visually?
2. What interactions should be available?
3. What feedback should users receive?
4. How should it integrate with existing UI?

### **Data & State:**
1. What data does this feature manage?
2. How should data be stored and retrieved?
3. What validation is required?
4. How should data relationships work?

### **Edge Cases:**
1. What happens with invalid inputs?
2. What if operations fail?
3. What are the boundary conditions?
4. How should errors be handled?

### **Technical Details:**
1. Should we follow existing patterns?
2. What performance is expected?
3. What compatibility is required?
4. How should it scale?

## üéØ Success Criteria

A feature development is successful when:

### **Before Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ All clarifying questions have been asked and answered
- ‚úÖ Complete implementation plan is documented
- ‚úÖ User has reviewed and approved the plan
- ‚úÖ No ambiguity remains about requirements

### **After Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Feature works exactly as specified
- ‚úÖ All edge cases are handled correctly
- ‚úÖ User interface matches requirements
- ‚úÖ Performance meets expectations
- ‚úÖ User confirms satisfaction with result

## üìö Example: Three-Dot Action Menu

### **Initial Request:**
"Change the action buttons to three dots with a dropdown menu containing Edit, Delete, Insert Above, Insert Below, Duplicate"

### **Clarification Questions Asked:**
1. Menu positioning (below vs above)
2. Duplicate behavior (copy all data vs partial)
3. Insert logic (inherit data vs blank)
4. Menu styling (colors, icons, separators)
5. Animation details (speed, type)
6. Error handling (first/last task insertion)
7. Cancel behavior (modal cancellation)

### **Complete Plan Created:**
- Detailed HTML structure
- CSS styling specifications
- JavaScript function requirements
- Error handling scenarios
- Implementation steps
- Success criteria

### **Result:**
- ‚úÖ Feature implemented correctly on first attempt
- ‚úÖ All requirements met
- ‚úÖ User satisfied with result
- ‚úÖ No rework required

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### **After Each Feature:**
- Review the process for effectiveness
- Identify areas for improvement
- Update this SOP based on learnings
- Refine question templates
- Improve plan documentation

### **Key Principles:**
- **Ask more questions** - Better to over-clarify than under-clarify
- **Document everything** - Clear plans prevent misunderstandings
- **Get user approval** - Never implement without confirmation
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify against all requirements
- **Learn from mistakes** - Improve process continuously
