# PCFP Development Guide - Cursor Branch

## Overview
This is the **Cursor Branch** of PCFP with enhanced architecture, error handling, and code quality improvements.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Consolidated Architecture**
- ✅ Removed duplicate router system (`core/kernel.js`)
- ✅ Removed duplicate event system (`core/bus.js`)
- ✅ Removed duplicate store system (`core/profile_repo.js`)
- ✅ Unified all systems under single, consistent patterns

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ Added try/catch blocks throughout core systems
- ✅ Improved error logging with context
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- ✅ Better user experience during errors

### 3. **Code Quality Tools**
- ✅ Added ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.json`)
- ✅ Added package.json with development scripts
- ✅ Standardized code formatting
- ✅ Added development documentation

### 4. **Improved Event System**
- ✅ Enhanced `core/services/events.js` with better error handling
- ✅ Added debug helpers for troubleshooting
- ✅ Consistent event patterns across the application

### 5. **Enhanced Store System**
- ✅ Improved `core/store/store.js` with error handling
- ✅ Better data validation and persistence
- ✅ Unified data access layer

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14.0.0
- Python 3 (for local server)

### Installation
```bash
# Install development dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Check for code issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix code issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
1. **Router**: `core/kernel.standalone.js` - Navigation and routing
2. **Events**: `core/services/events.js` - Pub/sub event system
3. **Store**: `core/store/store.js` - Data persistence and management
4. **Versioning**: `core/config.js` - Centralized version management

### Module System
- Each module is independent with its own version
- Modules communicate via events
- Data persistence through unified store
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Versioning System
- **Main App**: `window.APP_BUILD` in `core/config.js`
- **Modules**: `window.MODULE_VERS[moduleKey]` in `core/config.js`
- **Documentation**: `VERSIONING_GUIDE.md`

## Error Handling Strategy
1. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if parts fail
2. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for users
3. **Developer Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative paths when primary fails

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for critical paths
- Console logging for debugging
- Error boundary patterns for module isolation

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of modules
- Efficient DOM queries
- Minimal bundle size
- Optimized event handling

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add TypeScript support
- [ ] Add build process
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Comparison with ChatGPT Branch
This branch focuses on:
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, error handling, documentation
- **Architecture**: Consolidated systems, unified patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure, consistent patterns
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling, debugging helpers

Compare this approach with the ChatGPT branch to determine which direction to pursue.
