- ❌ **Hard to adjust** - Rigid, outdated architecture  
- ❌ **Slow & laggy** - 20-year-old system showing its age
- ❌ **Locked in** - Can't evolve or scale

### **PCFP Advantages:**
- ✅ **API-First** - Everything designed for integration
- ✅ **Flexible** - Easy to adjust and customize
- ✅ **Fast & Modern** - Performance-optimized architecture
- ✅ **Future-Proof** - Scalable for billion-dollar growth

- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start development server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

## 📊 Module System

Each module is independent with its own version and functionality:

| Module | Purpose | Version |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 💸 **Payment Planner** | Financial planning & payment tracking | v7.5 |
| 📅 **Schedule** | Project scheduling & timeline management | v1.2 |
| 📝 **Daily Logs** | Daily activity logging & reporting | v1.0 |
| ✅ **To-Dos** | Task management & completion tracking | v1.0 |
| 🔁 **Change Orders** | Change order management & approval | v1.0 |
| 🎯 **Selections** | Material & vendor selection tracking | v1.0 |

| 🧾 **Invoices** | Invoice creation & management | v1.0 |

## 🔧 Versioning System

### **Dual-Versioning Policy**
PCFP uses a sophisticated dual-versioning system:

1. **Build Version** (`v8.4`)
   - Shows in sidebar as "Build v8.4"
   - Changes with every application iteration
   - Reflects core system improvements
   - Defined in `core/config.js` as `APP_META.build`

2. **Module Versions** (`v1.0`)
   - Shows in each module header
   - Only changes when that specific module's code changes
   - Independent of other modules and core system
   - Defined in `core/config.js` as `window.MODULE_VERS[moduleKey]`

### **Version Management**
- **Centralized**: All versioning managed in `core/config.js`
- **No Hardcoding**: UI elements pull from centralized source
- **Independent**: Module versions evolve separately
- **Clear Separation**: Build version ≠ Module versions
- **✅ Stable**: Versioning system is now stable and conflict-free

## 🛠️ Development

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3 (for local server)
- Modern web browser
- Node.js (for development tools)

### **Code Quality**
```bash
# Check for code issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix code issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
The application includes comprehensive performance monitoring:
- **Real-time metrics** - Track operation performance
- **Slow operation detection** - Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Cache statistics** - Monitor data caching efficiency
- **Event performance** - Track event handler performance

## 🔌 API Integration

### **Current API-Ready Features**
- **RESTful Design** - All services designed as potential API endpoints
- **JSON Data Contracts** - Standardized data exchange format
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive API error management
- **Performance Monitoring** - API call performance tracking

### **Future Python Backend Integration**
```javascript
// Example of future API integration
const apiConfig = {
  baseUrl: '/api/v1',
  timeout: 30000,
  retryAttempts: 3
};

// API calls will be handled by Python backend
const projects = await store.apiCall('/api/v1/projects');
```
